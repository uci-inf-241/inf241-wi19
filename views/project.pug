		h1 Project
		p A course project will be a major component of your work. It will require hands-on experience with Ubiquitous Computing, while remaining open to different possibilities.
		p Because you are still new to Ubiquitous Computing research, we do not necessarily expect you to produce publishable work. Instead, the expectation is that you will do something 
			em interesting
			| . It is then up to you to define 
			em interesting
			|  according to what you want to accomplish in this project, seeking appropriate feedback from the staff. For example, you might choose to:
			ul
				li Design or implement a new piece of ubiquitous technology.
				li Design and execute an appropriately compelling study with implications for ubiquitous computing.
				li Perform a feasibility analysis or pilot study to inform future research plans in the space of ubiquitous computing.
				li Replicate an existing study or technology in the space of ubiquitous computing.
				li Execute a sufficiently interesting design problem with a ubiquitous technology (i.e., focusing on design without regard to research novelty).
		p We expect most students will do projects in groups of three. We will consider groups of two, and very strongly discourage individuals. Working in groups is a necessary part of doing research, and is also important for the logistics of this course.
		p Some sample project ideas will be gathered ahead of time on Slack. You can also use that discussion to identify potential project partners and post your own ideas.
		h2 Early Feedback
		p Course staff will be made available to meet and provide early feedback as desired.
		p Meeting is optional. You can also email to request feedback or inquire about arranging another time to meet.
		h2 Project Deliverables
		p Project deliverables are defined in terms of a 
			em proposal
			| , a 
			em milestone
			| , a 
			em final poster
			| , and a 
			em final report
			| . These are due:
			ul
				each project in projects
					li=project.title + ': ' + project.due.format("MMMM D")
		h3(id="proposal") Project Proposal
		p Your proposal will define your initial plan for this project. You can and should update this plan based on feedback, progress, and findings. But the proposal needs to demonstrate a robust initial plan for your project.
		p You are welcome and even encouraged to align your project with your research or other goals outside this course. However, it is critical to define what you will accomplish in the course project. The course project must stand on its own.
		h4 Document
		p Prepare a 1 page document addressing the following points:
		ul
			li 
				p What makes the project interesting? What is the problem or research question?
				p What is the pain point you want to solve, the new capability you want to enable, or research you want to explore?
			li
				p What existing understanding of the problem has been developed?
				p For a research proposal, this will briefly cover the most important related work in the space you are exploring.
				p For a dsign proposal, this will introduce existing solutions, why they fall short, and the potential opportunity.
			li
				p What will the group plan to accomplish by the milestone? By the end of the quarter?
				p You will be asked to revisit these plans during the milestone and final reports.
			li What might the group explicitly decide to omit?
				p Progress requires compromise, as you cannot accomplish everything. Explain what aspects of the project you might choose to ignore or defer in this course. This is your opportunity to scope the project appropriately for this course.
		h4 Presentation
		p Prepare a presentation consisting of 3 to 4 slides. Each group will give a short in-class presentation the week following the proposal.
		p This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates. Your presentation should cover the same information as the document. The primary goal is feedback, not a formal presentation. Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.
		h4 Submission
		each project in projects
			if project.anchor == 'proposal'
				p='Due ' + project.due.format("dddd, MMMM Do, YYYY [at] hh:mma") + '.'
				p Submit your proposal document in PDF format: 
					a(href=project.link.document)=project.link.document
				p Submit your proposal presentation in PDF, PPTX, or KEY format: 
					a(href=project.link.presentation)=project.link.presentation
		h3(id="milestone") Milestone Report
		p The milestone report serves as a check on the trajectory of your project and an opportunity for feedback and guidance. Convey the state of your project and your plans for the remainder of the quarter.
		h4 Document
		p Prepare a 1 page document addressing the following points:
		ul
			li What you have done to this point, discussing current progress relative to previously stated plans.
			li What you will do before the final report, including any adaptations based on your status or findings.
			li Any areas where you could use advice or are blocked. It may help to reference a part of your appendix.
		p Feel free to include any materials relevant to your progress as an appendix (e.g., does not count toward the 1 page limit). Example materials would be screenshots from a current prototype, mockups of an in-progress design, an interview or survey protocol, or bulleted notes from a literature review. You can also link to external materials better accessible outside of a document (e.g., a GitHub repository, a live interactive wireframe).
		h4 Presentation
		p Prepare a presentation consisting of 3 to 4 slides. Each group will give a short in-class presentation the week following the proposal.
		p This is an opportunity for feedback from staff and classmates. Your presentation should cover the same information as the document. The primary goal is feedback, not a formal presentation. Please be appropriately candid, thoughtful, and engaged.

				p Submit your milestone presentation in PDF, PPTX, or KEY format: 
					a(href=project.link.presentation)=project.link.presentation
		h3(id="finalposter") Final Poster
		p Create a poster which summarizes the core contributions of your project. Your poster should include your project title, your names, the key problem being addressed, and your solution.
		p Your poster should include images and limited amounts of text. A PowerPoint template is available: 
			a(href="/files/poster_template.pptx") Coloryzer Project PowerPoint Template
			| .
		p You should heavily modify the template to be unique and represent your project. During the poster session, your team will give a one-minute pitch. Your poster will be projected on a screen near you rather than be printed out.
		h4 Submission
		each project in projects
			if project.anchor == 'finalposter'
				p='Due ' + project.due.format("dddd, MMMM Do, YYYY [at] hh:mma") + '.'
				p Submit your poster in PDF format: 
					a(href=project.link)=project.link
		h3(id="finalreport") Final Report
		p Prepare a final report that is 4 to 10 pages in length, excluding references.
		p Your final report should be presented in the same general structure as the papers you read this quarter:
		ul
			li Introduction and Motivation
			li Statement of Contributions
			li Related Work
			li Description / Methods / Results
			li Discussion / Future Work / Conclusion
		p Write according to the content you have. Be appropriate thorough and precise in your presentation, but do not needlessly pad your text.
		p Use the ACM Master Template Format: 
			a(href="https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions#h-acm-master-template") https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions#h-acm-master-template
			| . You may need to install fonts included in the template download (e.g., Linux Biolinum). You may use either Word or LaTeX to prepare your paper. Do not spend substantial time trying to correct formatting inconsistencies, just do your best.
		p Additional guidance regarding effective paper writing can be found in:
